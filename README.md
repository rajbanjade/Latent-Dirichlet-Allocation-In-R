# Latent-Dirichlet-Allocation-In-R
 This is an R implementation of 
 Latend Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using (Collapsed) Gibbs Sampling.

Please go through the code. I hope that the comments in the code itself give you a walk through of it.
Additional details maybe available, if not here, at https://umdrive.memphis.edu/rbanjade/public/

To run it, all you need is to: 
    (a) provide an input file, each line containing a document and tokens separated by one or more whitespaces or tabs.   
        A sample input file can be found along with this file.  
    (b) set few parameters (optional). Otherwise, the default parameter values will be used.   

 I would suggest you review following topics before reading LDA.  
   (a) Distributions - Multinomial distribution, Dirichlet distribution  
   (b) Sampling - Gibbs Sampling  
   (c) Conjugate distributions
